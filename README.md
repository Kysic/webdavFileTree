# WebDAVFileTree
Pure html/javascript example page to display the content of a remote webdav directory.

It's in fact just a connector between two existing HTML/javascript code :
 - jquery.fileTree from Cory LaViska available at http://www.abeautifulsite.net/jquery-file-tree/
(slightly modified to work with javascript connectors instead of connector on a remote server).
 - jsdavclient, a "Low-level JavaScript WebDAV client implementation written in Javascript" from Sven vogler,
 available at https://github.com/svogler and use as it is.
